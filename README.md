you can clone and use this project in the following way:
1. clone the github project
2. install requirements
    * pip install -r requirements
3. database init and migration

4. run the app with flask run and click in the localhost url
5. you can create a user by
    * going to app.py and looking for the insert function  
    * change the settings to your liking and then go to http://<your_ip_address>:<your_localhost>/insert
